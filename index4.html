    <div class="summary">
        <p>Businessmen: you still have a shitty website and you’re behind schedule. Just shut down the project.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>in the words of Paul Ford:</h2>
    <div class= "ogtext">
        <p>More months go by. Nothing is built. The old website remains, showing its age, infuriating everyone. Pressure mounts. Pressure from above and below. The re-architecture has failed. The new CTO is a charlatan. TMitTB has apparently spent all of his time at conferences and no time actually working.</p>
        <p>These things are not spoken out loud; it’s not that kind of company. Things are said through eye rolls and shrugs in the hallway, in the ordering of addresses in e-mails, and via BCC. You let your antennae work. You hear words such as “boondoggle” and “late” and phrases like “not operationally sound.” There’s a lot about compliance and governance.</p>
        <p>Earlier in your career, you might have panicked. Instead, you feel a sense of calm. You call the CTO and TMitTB to your office, as soon as they’re back in the vicinity. They come in looking sheepish. The CTO is braced, her shoulders firm. TMitTB oscillates between sheepish and angry.</p>
        <p>“People believe,” you say, pointing upward, where the C-suite is, “that it is time to cut our losses and shut down this project.”</p>
